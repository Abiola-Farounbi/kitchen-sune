# Maple Walnut Cranberry Relish

I make this relish every fall for our Thanksgiving dinner, celebrated in the US on the 3rd Thursday in November. It's a little tart and, according to my family, so much better than the canned sauce.

Since the relish lasts for several weeks, we use often the extras with breakfast toast. It can also be used as a topping on vanilla ice cream.

Thanks to [Chef John at AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235618/maple-walnut-cranberry-sauce/) for the inspiration. üòç

## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries, rinsed and drained
- 3/4 cup orange juice (with pulp)
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3/4 cup chopped walnuts

## Method

1. Place cranberries into a large saucepan and stir in orange juice, maple syrup, sugar, ginger, orange zest, and cinnamon stick.
2. Bring sauce to a simmer. Berries will begin to pop. Cook at a simmer until berries are cooked through and soft, about 10 minutes.
3. Remove saucepan from heat and let cranberry sauce cool for about 5 minutes.
4. Stir the walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, cooking until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
5. Vigorously shake the walnuts in a colander to remove the bitter outer skin.
6. Stir walnuts into cranberry sauce. Let cool to room temperature and transfer to a serving bowl. The relish will thicken as it cools.
7. Refrigerate until needed. For best results, give the relish a few days before serving.
